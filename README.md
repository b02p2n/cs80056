Paper 2: Partial Rough Draft 
Description: 
Academic writing involves asking questions (which you did in your prompt) and then attempting to answer those questions by working through multiple drafts. As you move from a rough draft to a more polished, final version, your thinking should evolve.In light of this, you are being asked to turn in a rough draft of Paper 2. Turning in a rough draft not only will help you get started on the assignment, but also will   provide you an opportunity to get feedback on your draft from your peers and (if you choose) from your TA and/or your instructor.
Basic Requirements: 
•   The partial rough draft is due, on Canvas, by Sunday, Nov. 10. 
•   The partial rough draft must be at least 1,000 words in length. (The final draft is longer—the final draft must be 1,200 to 1,500 words, not including the Works Cited Page).

Tips for Getting Started on Your Draft: 
•   In your early drafts, write for your own understanding. Don’t feel like you have to have an argument right off the bat in your first draft and don’t worry about your audience until you start revising. Instead, describe what you noticed about your object, note what seemed strange, ask questions as they come up, and observe any patterns that emerge. 
o It may seem like doing this sort of exploratory writing takes precious time away from writing the paper, but it will ultimately make the paper go faster—you are generating ideas and getting your thoughts straight, not wasting time! 
•    Dwell on what puzzles you.
•   Consider which course reading(s) help you analyze your object.
